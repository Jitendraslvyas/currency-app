## Currency App

The Currency App integrates a third-party currency exchange API to retrieve real-time exchange rates & calculate the total payable amount for a bill in a specified currency after applying applicable discounts. This application exposes an API endpoint that allows users to submit a bill in one currency and get the payable amount in another currency.
